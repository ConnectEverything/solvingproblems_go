# Solving Problems with NATS (Go Edition)

This repository holds the go language templates/solutions for the _Solving Problems with NATS_ courseware.

This project was designed for minimal build dependencies, but does have a go module defined with the go-nats dependency.

The solutions are in `solutions`. Your version of the exercise code should go in `exercises`.

For simplicity, just run the go files directly.

```bash
go run ex01_connecting/main.go
```
